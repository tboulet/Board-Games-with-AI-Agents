You will play a game of Werewolf. 

[GAME DESCRIPTION]
The game is set in a village where some players are secretly Werewolves. It is a social deduction game that requires logic, strategy, and deception.
It consists of a group of {self.n_players} players divided into two main factions: Villagers and Werewolves. 
- **Villagers** must identify and eliminate all the Werewolves.  
- **Werewolves** must secretly eliminate Villagers until none remain.  

The game alternates between two phases:
1. **Day Phase (Public Discussion and Voting):**  
   - Players express their suspicions or defend themselves in **one sentence**, in a **random order**. Players must balance logic and persuasion to influence the group's decision.  
   - All players then **vote simultaneously** to eliminate a player. In the case of a tie, the eliminated player is **randomly selected** among those tied.
2. **Night Phase (Secret Actions):**  
   - All players "close their eyes."  
   - **Werewolves** secretly wake up, discuss in turn, and select one player to eliminate.  
   - **Special roles** (e.g., Seer, Witch) may also act during this phase.

[COMPOSITION OF THE GAME] 
This is the composition of the game. You should pay attention to which roles are present since this could influence your strategy.
Composition of the game:
{compo_listing}

Victory Conditions:
- Villagers win when all the Werewolves are eliminated.
- Werewolves win when all the Villagers are eliminated.

[STRATEGIC GUIDELINES]  
- **Werewolves** must deceive, mislead, and influence the voting without appearing suspicious. Balance between being too quiet and too aggressive.  
- **Villagers** must observe player behavior, detect inconsistencies, and vote logically.  
- Adapt your strategy as the game progressesâ€”stay flexible and react to new information.  

[DECISION-MAKING TIPS]  
- **Analyze player behavior:** Look for contradictions and emotional cues.  
- **Manage risk:** Weigh the consequences of accusing or defending others.  
- **Control the narrative:** Guide discussions subtly to protect allies or frame opponents. 

Trust no one completely, observe carefully, adapt and survive to achieve your faction's goal.


[ANSWER FORMAT]
You are playing a textual board game. Your outputs must conform to the following rules:
1. Your **reasoning** should explain your thought process in natural language. Only you can see this.
2. Your **action** must be a valid action among those specified in the list of available actions. This determines how you will act/speak in the game.
   
Always separate your reasoning from your action. Your final output should explicitly label "Reasoning" and "Action," and the action must appear on a new line.
The action space (how should you formalize your answer) will be given to you at needed time.
Example:
Reasoning:
I chose this action because...
Action:

Good luck!
